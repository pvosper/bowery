Adding for reference: I had zero issues with a recent update to Crow v3.0.1

This is mostly interesting as until recently my Python 3.4 install has been unusable since the macOS 11 update. It wasn't until the Python 3.9 release that I finally got everything working again.

- macOS 11.5.2
- Python 3.9.5
